# 🐄 AI-Based Vision Technology for Real-time Monitoring of Enteric Fermentation Methane Emissions in Dairy Cattle

## 🌍 Why This Project?

Methane emissions from enteric fermentation in dairy cattle are one of the largest contributors to agricultural greenhouse gases. With increasing global concern over climate change and sustainable agriculture, there is a growing need for innovative solutions to monitor and reduce these emissions without compromising animal health or productivity.

This project introduces an **AI-powered vision and data analytics system** that predicts and analyzes methane emissions in real-time, based on cattle breed, feed composition, age, weight, and activity. The goal is to enable smarter decision-making for farmers, researchers, and policymakers in the pursuit of **eco-friendly livestock management**.

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🌱 **Environmental Monitoring**: Understand the environmental impact of cattle methane emissions using machine learning.
- 🧠 **Data-Driven Farming**: Assist farmers and researchers in optimizing diet and management strategies for healthier cattle and lower emissions.
- 🔬 **Scientific Insight**: Visualize how different variables—like fiber content, grazing hours, or fat levels—affect methane output.
- 📊 **Real-time Dashboard**: Provide an interactive Streamlit dashboard for live predictions, scenario simulations, and breed comparisons.
